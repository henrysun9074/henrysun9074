    <h1>Basketball</h1>
    <p>I'm from Maryland so for some reason I support the "Washington Wizards". Stay tuned for the start of the 2024 NBA season for 100% accurate free agent analysis, advanced stats, playoff and award predictions, and more.</p>
    <p>Currently: watching summer league and WNBA, excited for the Olympics!! Recency bias - I think the Wizards should have drafted Reed Sheppard.</p>

     <p>As for playing basketball: I've been hooping since I was young. Nowadays I want to be able to dunk (I'm 5'10). But that would require a lot of effort to train, just like one of those motivational YouTube videos. 
        If I do eventually devote the time, this page will be the first to know.</p>
