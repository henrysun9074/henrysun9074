### Project Overview

<p class="project-description">Summer 2024 NSF REU at Rutgers University. Working on evaluating the effectiveness of various dimensionality reduction techniques for encoding eDNA data, including linear and non-linear methods: principal component analysis (PCA), tSNE and UMAP, and a custom variational autoencoder (VAE). Subsequently aiming to use oceanographic data generated from the DOPPIO model and CTD profiles taken during eDNA sampling to predict fish community structure using random forests. Page will be updated with preliminary results at the end of the REU August 9th.</p>
