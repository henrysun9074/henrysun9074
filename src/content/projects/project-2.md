### Project Overview and Rationale

<p class="project-description">Duke Independent Study project and planned senior thesis. Awarded $8,000 NASA NC Space Grant for 2024-25 school year to conduct research.</p>

I started this project in October 2023 after meeting with Dave, and we quickly realized that, despite the endless stream of innovations within the field of generative AI flooding the general public, very few researchers were thinking about its applications in ecology and conservation biology.
